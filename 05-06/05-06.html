      When I find myself in times of trouble,<br />
      Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be And in my hour
      of darkness she is standing right in front of me Speaking words of wisdom,
      let it be
    </div>
    <div class="chorus">
      Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be Whisper words of wisdom, let it

      And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree There will be
      an answer, let it be For though they may be parted, there is still a
      chance that they will see There will be an answer, let it be
    </div>
    <div class="chorus">
      Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be<br />
      There will be an answer, let it be

      And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
      Shinin' until tomorrow, let it be I wake up to the sound of music, Mother
      Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
    </div>
    And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be Whisper words of wisdom, let
    it be And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be Whisper words of
    wisdom, let it be
